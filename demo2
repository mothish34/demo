Introduction
The World Wide Web has revolutionized the way people communicate, work, and access information. Since its creation in 1989, the web has evolved significantly, transforming from a simple information-sharing system to an advanced digital space that integrates artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud computing. This paper explores the stages of web evolution, its role in modern society, and its potential future impact.

The Evolution of the Web
The web has gone through three major phases, each bringing significant advancements in technology and user experience.

Web 1.0: The Static Web (1990s)
The first stage of the web, known as Web 1.0, consisted of static web pages that provided information but lacked interactivity. Websites were basic, primarily used for reading content, and offered limited user engagement. Some key features included:

Read-only websites with no user interaction
Basic HTML structures with simple hyperlinks
Limited multimedia content and slow internet speeds
Web 2.0: The Interactive Web (Early 2000sâ€“Present)
The emergence of Web 2.0 introduced user-generated content, social networking, and dynamic websites. This phase marked the rise of platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia, where users could contribute, share, and interact online. Key features of Web 2.0 include:

Interactive and user-friendly interfaces
Social media platforms and online communities
Cloud computing and data storage advancements
The rise of e-commerce and online marketplaces
Web 3.0: The Intelligent Web (Present and Future)
Web 3.0 represents the next stage in internet evolution, incorporating artificial intelligence, decentralized networks, and enhanced security. It aims to provide a more personalized and secure web experience. Some key elements include:

AI-powered search engines and smart assistants
Blockchain technology ensuring data security and decentralization
Internet of Things (IoT) connecting smart devices
